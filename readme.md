# Type-safe error handling with context-receivers and Raise from Arrow functional libs

Experimenting with the prototype of [context-receivers](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/whatsnew1620.html#prototype-of-context-receivers-for-kotlin-jvm) introduced in kotlin [1.6.20](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/whatsnew1620.html) 
and Arrow's Raise release candidate(version 1.2.0-RC).

**This is an early version, therefore we could expect changes in the apis.**
